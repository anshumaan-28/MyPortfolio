  <h1>WTF is Perplexity?</h1>
  
  <p class="highlight">
    Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine and answer engine that combines the capabilities of large language models with real-time web searching to deliver comprehensive, cited answers to user queries.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Makes Perplexity Different?</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike traditional search engines that return a list of links, Perplexity generates complete, natural language responses to questions. It not only pulls information from across the web but synthesizes it into coherent answers with proper citations, making it easy to verify sources.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Real-time Information:</strong> Perplexity pulls information from the current web, not just from its training data, ensuring you get up-to-date answers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Source Citations:</strong> Every piece of information comes with links to sources, allowing users to verify claims and dig deeper into topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Conversational Interface:</strong> Users can ask follow-up questions, making the search experience more natural and efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Multi-modal Capabilities:</strong> Perplexity can understand and process not just text but also images, expanding the ways users can query information.
  </p>

  <h2>How Can I Use Perplexity?</h2>
  <p>
    Perplexity can be accessed through its website (perplexity.ai) or mobile apps. There's a free tier that allows basic usage, while Pro subscriptions offer advanced features like GPT-4 powered responses, higher usage limits, and the ability to upload documents for analysis.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Use Cases</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Research:</strong> Quickly gather information from multiple sources on complex topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Learning:</strong> Get explanations on difficult concepts with examples and references.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Decision Making:</strong> Compare options with up-to-date information from across the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Content Creation:</strong> Find relevant data and insights to support writing and creative projects.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    While powerful, Perplexity isn't perfect. It may occasionally include incorrect information, especially when sources themselves are inaccurate. Critical thinking is still required to evaluate responses. Additionally, complex or nuanced topics might require deeper research beyond what Perplexity provides.
  </p>
  
  <p class="highlight">
    In summary, Perplexity represents a new breed of AI-powered search tools that blend the comprehensive knowledge of large language models with the real-time capabilities of web search, creating a more efficient and user-friendly way to find information online.
